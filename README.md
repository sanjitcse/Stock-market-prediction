Share market is one of the most unpredictable and place of high interest in the world. There are no significant methods exist to predict the share price. Mainly people use three ways such as fundamental analysis, statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the share price of share market but none of these methods are proved as a consistently acceptable prediction tool. So developing a prediction tool is one of the challenging tasks as share price depends on many influential factor and features. In this paper, we propose a robust method to predict the share rate using neural network based model and compare how it differ with the actual price. For that we collect the share market data of last 6 months of 10 companies of different categories, reduce their high dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) so that the Backpropagation neural network will be able to train faster and efficiently and make a comparative analysis between Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) algorithm and our method for prediction of next day share price. In order to justify the effectiveness of the system, different test data of companies stock are used to verify the system. We introduce a robust method which can reduce the data dimensionality and predict the price based on artificial neural network.
